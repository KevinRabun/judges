# Changelog

All notable changes to **@kevinrabun/judges** are documented here.

## [3.14.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Combined Layer 1 + Layer 2 deep review** — new `@judges /deepreview` chat sub-command and `Judges: Deep Review (Layer 1 + Layer 2)` VS Code command. Runs all 35 deterministic evaluators (L1), then sends findings + source code to GPT-4o with the full tribunal deep-review prompt (L2) for contextual AI analysis — all in a single user action.
- **`/deepreview` chat sub-command** — streams L1 findings grouped by severity with fix buttons, then streams the L2 LLM deep-review response directly in Copilot Chat. Gracefully degrades to L1-only when no LLM is available.
- **`judges.deepReview` command** — accessible from command palette and editor context menu (🚀 icon). Runs L1 + L2 and opens the full report as a new markdown tab.
- **Deep-review prompt builders exported from public API** — `buildSingleJudgeDeepReviewSection` and `buildTribunalDeepReviewSection` are now available via `@kevinrabun/judges/api`.
- **10 new tests** (1220 total): deep-review intent detection (3), L1→L2 prompt construction (3), tribunal section validation (2), JUDGES array contract (1), API export accessibility (1).

## [3.13.1] — 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **10 evaluator false-positive fixes** from real-world Copilot review feedback:
  - **REL-002** (reliability) — expanded timeout context window from 5 lines to ±15 lines; added file-level `AbortController`/`AbortSignal`/`signal` scan so files with centralized timeout handling are not flagged.
  - **SOV-002** (data-sovereignty) — added egress gate detection (`assertAllowedEgress`, `egressPolicy`, `jurisdictionCheck`, etc.) to suppress cross-border findings when a guard function exists.
  - **SOV-004** (data-sovereignty) — added centralized sovereignty response handler detection (`finalizeSovereignResponse`, `sovereigntyMiddleware`, etc.) to suppress export-path findings.
  - **SOV-007** (data-sovereignty) — added telemetry kill-switch detection; files that throw on external telemetry enable are no longer flagged.
  - **SOV-008** (data-sovereignty) — tightened PII partition rule to require concrete DB mutation evidence (SQL DML in query context or ORM method calls) instead of matching generic verbs like `create`/`save`.
  - **DOC-001** (documentation) — undocumented-function rule now only flags exported/public functions. Internal helpers, private utilities, and language-specific private patterns (`_`-prefixed in Python, non-`pub` in Rust) are skipped.
  - **A11Y form error** (accessibility) — form error ARIA rule now gated on HTML/JSX rendering evidence; pure backend files generating validation schemas are no longer flagged.
  - **SCALE-003** (scalability) — replaced generic `*Sync(` regex with an explicit list of 30+ known Node.js synchronous blocking APIs. Custom functions like `ensureModelSync()` or `performDataSync()` are no longer flagged.
  - **AUTH-002** (authentication) — added public endpoint marker detection (`isPublic`, `@PermitAll`, `noAuth`, `AllowAnonymous`, etc.) and health-check-only route file suppression.
  - **DB-006** (database) — tightened mutation detection to require SQL DML in `query()`/`execute()` context or ORM method calls; function names containing `create`/`update`/`delete` no longer trigger false positives.

### Added
- **15 new regression tests** (1235 total) covering all 10 false-positive fixes, including both negative cases (FP suppressed) and positive cases (real issues still detected) for DOC-001, A11Y, SCALE-003, AUTH-002, and DB-006.

## [3.13.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added
- **AI-assisted false-positive refinement** — new `Judges: Refine Findings with AI` VS Code command (context menu + command palette). Uses GPT-4o to review pattern-matched findings against source code and filter out false positives. Reports how many findings were dismissed vs confirmed.
- **Deep-review false-positive instructions** — both single-judge and tribunal deep-review prompt builders now include a "False Positive Review" section instructing the LLM to identify and dismiss pattern findings that match string literals, function-scoped variables, nearby mitigation code, or test/example code. Dismissed findings are listed in a dedicated section and excluded from the verdict.
- **`isStringLiteralLine()` helper** — new helper in `shared.ts` that detects lines whose content is purely a string literal value (object properties, descriptions, examples). Used by `getLineNumbers` / `getLangLineNumbers` to auto-skip string-literal lines by default, preventing false positives from example text in strings.
- **String literal skipping in `getLineNumbers` / `getLangLineNumbers`** — both functions now skip string-literal-only lines by default (opt out with `{ skipStringLiterals: false }`). IaC languages (ARM/Terraform/Bicep) automatically opt out since their content is structured data where quoted values are meaningful.
- **34 new tests** (1210 total across 4 test files):
  - Deep-review single-judge prompt (8 tests) and tribunal prompt (7 tests).
  - `isStringLiteralLine` helper (7 tests).
  - `getLineNumbers` / `getLangLineNumbers` string literal skipping (4 tests).
  - String literal false-positive regressions for logging-privacy and performance evaluators (2 tests).
  - `refineWithAI` contract verification (6 tests): prompt building, index filtering, JSON array parsing.

### Fixed
- **7 evaluator false-positive fixes**:
  - **logging-privacy** — SQL regex no longer matches `SELECT` inside string literal values.
  - **data-sovereignty** — audit trail window scoped to function bodies instead of matching globally.
  - **performance** — unbounded collection scope limited to actual code context; event handler and pagination checks now skip string literal lines.
  - **internationalization** — currency regex anchored to avoid matching partial identifiers.
  - **scalability** — global mutable state scoping improved (function-local `let`/`var` no longer flagged).
- **IaC evaluator preserves detection in ARM templates** — `getLangLineNumbers` auto-disables string literal skipping for IaC languages so JSON key-value pairs aren't incorrectly filtered.

### Changed
- **README** — test badge updated from 925 to 1210; documented AI refinement capability.
- **VS Code extension README** — added `Judges: Refine Findings with AI` to commands table and features list.

## [3.12.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Technological sovereignty rules** — 3 new evaluator rules:
  - **SOV-011**: Vendor-managed encryption without key sovereignty (BYOK/CMK/HSM).
  - **SOV-012**: Proprietary AI/ML model dependency without abstraction layer.
  - **SOV-013**: Single identity provider coupling without OIDC/SAML federation.
- **Operational sovereignty rules** — 3 new evaluator rules:
  - **SOV-014**: External API calls without circuit breaker / resilience patterns.
  - **SOV-015**: Administrative operations without structured audit trail.
  - **SOV-016**: Data storage without export / portability mechanism.
- **3-pillar sovereignty systemPrompt** — judge definition expanded with 20 evaluation criteria across Data, Technological & Operational sovereignty pillars.
- **13 new tests** for technological and operational sovereignty rules including comment-skipping regression (925 total tests, 190 suites).

### Changed
- **Judge name** — "Judge Data Sovereignty" → "Judge Sovereignty".
- **Judge domain** — "Data Sovereignty & Jurisdictional Controls" → "Data, Technological & Operational Sovereignty".
- **README** — test badge 912 → 925; Data Sovereignty row and MCP prompt expanded.

## [3.11.4] — 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Zero lint errors** — resolved all remaining PROBLEMS across `daily-popular-repo-autofix.ts` (unused `RepoTimeoutError` class), `judges.test.ts` (9 unused imports), and `iac-security.ts` (unused post-increment value).
- **9 new comment-skipping regression tests** — authentication, API design, dependency health, compliance, observability, testing, internationalization, documentation, and ethics-bias evaluators now have dedicated false-positive regression tests (912 total tests, 188 suites).

### Changed
- **CHANGELOG** — added missing entries for v3.8.5 through v3.11.3 with link references.
- **README** — test badge updated from 842 to 912.
- **CONTRIBUTING** — test count updated from 700+ to 900+.
- **SECURITY** — supported versions table updated to reflect 3.11.x as current.

## [3.11.3] — 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Systemic comment-skipping across all evaluators** — added `isCommentLine()` helper to `shared.ts` with `COMMENT_LINE_RE` regex. `getLineNumbers()` and `getLangLineNumbers()` now skip comment lines by default. Added 123 individual `isCommentLine` guards to `forEach`/`for` loops across 20 evaluators. 9 intentional comment checks (TODO/FIXME, linter-disable, etc.) opted out with `{ skipComments: false }`.
- Added 10 regression tests for comment-skipping false positives (903 total tests, 188 suites).

## [3.11.2] — 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Recursion detector** limited body scan to actual function boundaries — previously could false-positive on identically named functions elsewhere in the file.
- **`var` in comments** no longer triggers maintainability or software-practices findings (`var oldConfig = {}` in a comment is not a code issue).

## [3.11.1] — 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Testing evaluator** — `describe`/`it` labels and word boundaries for `HttpClient` no longer produce false positives.
- **Data-sovereignty evaluator** — `export` embedded in identifiers and env vars no longer triggers; added word boundaries to `dr` and `replica` checks.
- **Documentation evaluator** — walks backwards through comment body for long JSDoc blocks to avoid false-positive "missing documentation" findings.

## [3.11.0] — 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **N+1 query check** now scans actual loop bodies instead of the entire file — eliminates false positives when queries exist outside loops.
- **Retry detection** recognizes `p-retry` and `backoff` libraries.
- **Cost-effectiveness** skips comment lines in loop detection.
- **Accessibility** skips comment and declaration lines.
- **Data-sovereignty** skips comment lines.
- **External dependency** detection skips comment lines.
- **API doc check** no longer false-positives on large JSDoc blocks.

## [3.10.1] — 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Auto-fix button** no longer falsely reports code changed when no patches were applied.

## [3.10.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added
- **IaC Security judge** (`IAC-*` rules) — Infrastructure-as-Code analysis for Terraform (`.tf`), Bicep (`.bicep`), and ARM templates (`.json`). Checks for overly permissive network rules, missing encryption, public access, hardcoded secrets in IaC definitions, and 15 other IaC-specific anti-patterns.

## [3.9.3] — 2026-03-01

### Improved
- **VS Code extension** — "Re-Evaluate" is now a chat followup that streams updated findings into chat (previously showed only a toast). Context-aware followups for `/security` and workspace reviews. Post-fix followup after `/fix`.
- **Auto-fix clarity** — each finding tagged with 🔧 (auto-fixable) or 📝 (manual review). Fixability summary in header. Dynamic button label ("Auto-Fix N of M Findings"). Button hidden when no findings are auto-fixable.

## [3.9.2] — 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **VS Code extension** — populated findings cache directly from chat review results; fixed Auto-Fix All and Re-Evaluate buttons not working after chat review.

## [3.9.1] — 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Workspace-wide review** — `@judges /review` in Copilot Chat can now evaluate all supported files in the workspace with progress reporting.

### Fixed
- **Tree-sitter AST** — made `tree-sitter-ast.ts` work in both ESM and CJS bundles.
- Added missing `toolReferenceName` to `languageModelTools` manifest.

## [3.9.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added
- **`@judges` chat participant** — type `@judges` in Copilot Chat to review, security-check, or auto-fix files. Slash commands: `/review`, `/security`, `/fix`, `/help`.
- **`judges_evaluate` Language Model tool** — registered via `vscode.lm.registerTool` so Copilot auto-discovers and invokes Judges evaluation.
- Disambiguation routing: Copilot auto-routes "judges panel review", "judges evaluation" queries.
- Domain-focused reviews and action buttons in chat responses.

## [3.8.7] — 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- Daily popular-repo autofix timeout and performance improvements.

## [3.8.5] — 2026-03-01

### Security
- Replaced ReDoS-prone regex with `indexOf` in `project.ts` (CodeQL alert 35).

## [3.8.4] — 2026-03-01

### Security
- Fixed 8 polynomial-ReDoS vulnerabilities flagged by CodeQL code scanning:
  - `structural-parser.ts`: PYTHON_CLASS regex — merged competing `\s*` quantifiers around optional base-list group.
  - `taint-tracker.ts`: GUARD_PATTERNS — eliminated `[ \t]*!?[ \t]*` overlap that caused polynomial backtracking.
  - `shared.ts`: health-check pattern — bounded `[^\n]*` to `{0,200}`; catch-block signal — replaced whole-file regex with line-by-line scan.
  - `dependencies.ts`: requirements.txt parser — replaced `[>=<~!]+` character class with explicit pip-operator alternation.
  - `project.ts`: import-path extractor — bounded `[^'"]` quantifier to `{1,500}`; normalise helper — replaced chained regex with `lastIndexOf` calls.
- Dismissed 6 false-positive / intentional alerts:
  - 2 intentional vulnerabilities in `examples/sample-vulnerable-api.ts` (demo file).
  - 4 URL-substring-sanitization false positives in test assertions.

## [3.8.3] — 2026-03-01

- Extension `package.json` description updated to mention auto-configured MCP.
- Root README: rewrote “Connect to Your Editor” section — VS Code extension is now the recommended zero-config path; manual MCP configs updated to use `npx` instead of absolute paths; added Cursor and generic MCP client examples.

## [3.8.2] — 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **`Judges: Configure MCP Server` command** — writes the MCP server definition to `.vscode/mcp.json` for users who prefer explicit workspace config.
- Extension engine bumped to VS Code `^1.99.0` for MCP API support.

## [3.7.3] — 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- Fixed CI workflow race condition: extension install failed because `@kevinrabun/judges@^3.7.2` wasn't propagated on npm yet.
- Workflow now uses local tarball (`npm pack`) for the extension build instead of relying on npm registry propagation.
- Removed dependency version sync from the extension publish step; `^3.7.1` semver range covers all 3.x patches.

## [3.7.2] — 2026-03-01

### Fixed
